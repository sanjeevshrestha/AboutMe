JSP Introduction Quiz
1. What is the main value of Java Server Pages?
- JSP are uses so that we don't have to write to out stream. This means we can write pure html tags in a file and this will be transpiled to statements writing to out streams. 

2. How are JSP pages related to servlets?
- JSP is transpiled to Servlet Java Code which in turn in converted to java servlet and run in container. 

3. How are JSP pages related to HTML?
- JSP can have html parts in the JSP page and it can be mixed with java code using expression languages, directives and tags. 

4. Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet .
- <% List styles =  request.getAttribute("styles");
    Iterator it =  styles.getIterator();
 %>
 These scriptlets are copied to _jspService method. As these are already a java statements, these are copied between the out statements. 

5. Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- <%! int count = 0;%> 
These are declared as instance variables in the JSP Servlet. 

6. Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- <%-- This is a comment --%>  
Comments are not transpiled to JSP Servlet.

7. Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
 - <p> My name is <%=u.getName()%> </p> 
 This are transpiled to print statements with the expression as write input. 

8. Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
- <%@ page import ="java.util.*" />
These directive will add an import statement in the servlet. 

9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.
- ${username}, This expression is evaluated as follows
-- Checks PAGE Scope for the expression "username", if it is found, it evaluates else
-- Checks REQUEST Scope for the expression "username", if it is found, it evaluates else
-- Checks SESSION Scope for the expression "username", if it is found, it evaluates else
-- Checks APPLICATION Scope for the expression "username", if it is found, it evaluates else
-- Ignores the expression. 
EL are null friendly

10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.
- If the attributes are is not an implicit attributes, the atributes listed in EL expression are searched in following order
- It will Search the PAGE, REQUEST, SESSION and then APPLICATION until the attribute is found. It then evaluates the found attributes based on attribute type. If the attribute is not found, it is ignored. 


11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact. 
- Request Dispatch is used to forward the request to other resources like jsp page, servlets. The request dispatcher is available from request.getRequestDispatcher() method. We can then use the forward() method to forward to new pages.
