JSP Custom Tags Quiz
1. Rewrite the JSP page in the first demo (forEach) to use scripting instead of the JSTL
-- 
 <table>
 <%
    List<Student> students = (List) request.getAttribute("students"); 
    Iterator it =  students.getIterator();
    while(it.hasNext())
    {
        Student student = it.next();
        out.print("<tr><td>"+student.name+"</td><td>"+student.age+"</td></tr>");
    }
 %>
 </table>

2. How do custom tags relate to JSTL?
- The JSTL provides most common tags that can be used in jsp page. Custom tags can be defined similar to JSTL to meet custom needs of the application.
3. What is the role of the URI in the TLD and the taglib directive?
- The URI attribute defines the url where the tags are located. The tab lib will try to find the tags declaration in the url. 
4. What is a tag handler class?
- Tag handler class is a class that is bound to the tag and handles the tag display and behavior. 
5. What is the role of attribute setters in a tag handler class?
- the attribute setter allows the tag to set the value of private variable in the tag handler class. The tag lib will try to find a setter for the attribute name in the tag handler. 
6. What is the role of the doTag() method in a tag handler class?
-  This method is called when the tag is rendered and allows to write html outputs. 
7. What does the operation getJspContext().getOut().write(“Hi Bob”) do when called in
a doTag() method?
- This method will get the current Output Writer from the current context and writes "Hi Bob";
8. What does the operation getJspBody().invoke(null) do when called in a doTag()
method? 
- When this is called in the doTag method, It will pass the output resulting from the execution of current JSP tag body to the client, not the jsp.
